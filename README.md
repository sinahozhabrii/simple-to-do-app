💻 Setup & Installation
To get started with this project, follow the steps below to set up your development environment and run the application locally.

1. Create a Virtual Environment
It’s a best practice to create a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. Use the following command to create one:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Create a virtual environment (if you don't have it already)
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
2. Install Dependencies
Once you have the virtual environment activated, install all the necessary packages by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Apply Database Migrations
Before running the app, you need to make sure your database schema is up to date. Run the following commands to create and apply the migrations:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Create migrations for any changes made to models
python manage.py makemigrations

# Apply the migrations to the database
python manage.py migrate
4. Create a Superuser (Optional)
If you need to access the Django admin panel, create a superuser account:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to set the username, email, and password.

5. Run the Development Server
Now that everything is set up, run the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py runserver
